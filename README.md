# 🛒 Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a superstore's sales dataset. It explores temporal trends, regional performance, shipping behavior, customer segmentation, and profitability patterns. It also includes exploratory visual analysis of possible relationships between variables such as discount, sales, and profit.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `SampleSuperstore.csv`, which contains records of customer orders including:

- Order and shipping dates  
- Product information  
- Customer segments  
- Geographic location  
- Discounts, sales, and profit 
---
## 🔍 Project Goals

- Explore patterns in sales and profit across time, categories, and regions.  
- Identify products and states that result in losses.  
- Analyze customer segments and shipping delays.  
- Visually investigate potential linear relationships between business metrics.  

Based on features such as:
- Segment
- Product
- Region/State
- Shipping mode
- Discount
- Time features (from Order Date)

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

- Temporal trends of orders and profits.
- Profit distribution by category, sub-category, and region.
- Scatter plots showing relationships between profit and discount, sales, and quantity.
- Boxplots to visualize shipping delays and segment behavior.
- Count plots for products and states with losses.

## 🤖 Predictive Exploration (Linear Trends)

- Explored potential relationships between variables such as Discount, Quantity, and Sales with Profit using scatter plots.  
- Visualized these patterns to understand if linear trends exist.  
- While a full regression model was not implemented, visual patterns and trends were examined to explore potential predictive relationships.
